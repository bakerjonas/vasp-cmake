CMake
------

The folder CMake/ contains a CMake based, alternative build system for vasp. 
The system is contributed as is, and is not officially maintained. The system
has been setup for vasp-5.3.2. For newer version the src/CMakeLists.txt will
most likely have to be edited, and new source files added.
